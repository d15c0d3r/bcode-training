--GUESS THE OUTPUT--

1-  12
    IIFE function is within the scope of 'var a';

2-  12 
    since 'var a' is reassigned in IIFE as '12'; it becomes accessible as '12' within IIFE only and accessible as '5' out of IIFE.

3-  12
    because 'var a' is still within IIFE and it is accessible as '12' in function which is returned by IIFE.

4-  10
    because 'var y' function's scope has reassigned value of 'var a' as '12' and since var is function scoped. it is accessible as '12' only in 'var y' function

5-  12
    because the nested IIFE is not reassigning the 'var a', but it is changing the global 'var a'.

6-  15
    'var a' is re assigned in IIFE so it is accessed as '15' in IIFE and '10' outside of it.
    'window' is just an object
